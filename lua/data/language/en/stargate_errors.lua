sg_err_11 =[[ The custom fonts are not installed, you will have to download the following file from our site and then install it in your addons folder:
<br>
<br><u>http://sg-carterpack.com/data/cap_fonts.zip</u>
<br>
<br>To install this please unzip the content and place the cap_fonts folder inside "Steam\steamapps\COMMON\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addon".
<br>After this you're good to go and fully have CAP Installed!
<br>
<br>The reason why you need to download these fonts separated is that the GMA workshop file type doesn't function with custom fonts (Gmod bug).
